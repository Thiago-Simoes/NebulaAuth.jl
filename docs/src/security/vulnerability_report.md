# Vulnerability Reporting and Handling Process

OrionAuth.jl is committed to maintaining a secure and reliable authentication system. This document describes the process for reporting, handling, and disclosing security vulnerabilities. The process does **not** involve CVE assignment and is designed for simple and efficient handling via GitHub.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Security issues should be reported privately and responsibly through the GitHub Security Advisories feature. To report a vulnerability:

1. Go to the OrionAuth.jl GitHub repository.
2. Open a new **Security Advisory** (under the "Security" tab → "Advisories" → "New draft security advisory").
3. Provide detailed information:
   - Description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
   - Potential impact.
   - Any relevant logs or PoCs (proof of concept).
   
Reports should **not** be submitted via issues or pull requests to avoid public disclosure.

## Handling and Response Timeline

After receiving a vulnerability report, the maintainers will make best efforts to:

- **Acknowledge receipt within 5 days**.
- **Analyze the issue and validate within a reasonable timeframe** (usually within 15 days depending on complexity).
- **Develop and test a fix as soon as practical**. No guaranteed timeline.
- **Publish a patched release and security advisory once resolved**.

---

## Disclosure

Once a fix is available:

- The security advisory will be updated and made public.
- A patched release will be published.
- Clear upgrade instructions and mitigation recommendations (if necessary) will be included.

---

## Limitations

- No guaranteed response or resolution timelines, but best efforts will always be made.
- No CVE assignment or external vulnerability database publication.
- Priority is given to critical and high-impact issues.
